## Functionalities

1.	My Music functionality
    - Once a user clicks on a song on the main page, he can see options to Play song or Add to his music. By clicking on the Add to My         Music option user can save a particular song to his playlist.
2.	Search functionality
    - Clicking on the search button navigates user to the search page where he can search for songs/albums/artists. Search results will
      dynamically update the results on the page. All the three tabs (songs, albums, artists) on the page will be updated by the search       results. After searching for a particular song user can play it from the same page. By clicking on the artists from the search           results page will be navigated to the albums of particular artists from where user can select an album and play songs in that           album.
3.	Admin Controls
    -	Admin also logs into the website as a normal user except that there will be an extra button for the admin user. When admin clicks       on this button, admin controls page will be loaded where an admin can add a song, update a song or delete a song. Once a song is         added as latest it will be displayed on the main page also.
